            <h3><a name="stat"></a>Probability and statistics</h3>
            <p> Probability and statistics are two related but separate academic disciplines. Statistical analysis often uses probability distributions, and the two topics are often studied together. However, probability theory contains much that is of mostly of mathematical interest and not directly relevant to statistics. Moreover, many topics in statistics are independent of probability theory.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
        
            <h3><a name="phys"></a>Physics</h3>
            <p>physics (from Ancient Greek: φύσις physis &quot;nature&quot;) is a natural science that involves the study of matter[1] and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.[2] More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universebehaves.[3][4][5]</p>
            <p>Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy.[6] Over the last two millennia, physics was a part ofnatural philosophy along with chemistry, certain branches of mathematics, andbiology, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right.[7] Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics andquantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
            <h3><a name="ecol"></a>Ecology</h3>
            <p>Ecology (from Greek: οἶκος, &quot;house&quot;; -λογία, &quot;study of&quot;[A]) is the scientific study of the relationships living organisms have with each other and with their natural environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount (biomass), number, and changing states of organisms within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche constructionactivities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by the biodiversity within them. Biodiversity refers to the varieties of species in ecosystems, the genetic variations they contain, and the processes that are functionally enriched by the diversity of ecological interactions</p>

                    <h3><a name="te"></a>Technical English:Writing, Reading and Speaking</h3>
            <p>As the field of Technical Writing has evolved, so has the eighth edition of Technical English. Known for its direct, no-nonsense writing style, plentiful and varied examples, and step-by-step instruction,Technical English leads students through the many facets of technical communication. The Eighth Edition retains much of the vision of the previous editions-it encompasses written, oral, and visual communication-but also reflects current practices in the field of technical writing. With continued emphasis on workplace communication, the focus remains on the entire writing process from planning through revision. Technical English emphasizes efficiency in the search for and evaluating information, designing and preparing graphics and other visuals, and choosing appropriate communication technology and media. In     	addition, the eighth edition suggests guidelines for research, employment, and grammatical usage.</p>

            <h3><a name="la"></a>Linear algebra </h3>
            <p> Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning finite or countably infinitedimensional vector spaces, as well as linear mappings between such spaces. Such an investigation is initially motivated by a system of linear equations in several unknowns. Such equations are  naturally represented using the formalism of matrices and vectors.[1 Linear algebra is central to both pure and applied mathematics. For instance, abstract algebra arises by relaxing the axioms of a vector space,  		leading to a number of generalizations.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
            <h3><a name="cal"></a>Calculus</h3>
            <p> Calculus (Latin, calculus, a small stone used for counting) is a branch of mathematicsfocused on limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. This subject constitutes a major part of modern mathematics education. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus, which are related by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Calculus is the study of change,[1] in the same way that geometry is the study of shape andalgebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits, broadly called mathematical analysis. Calculus has widespread applications in science, economics, and engineering and can solve many problems for whichalgebra alone is unsufficient.</p>

            <h3><a name="algo"></a>Algorithm and programming</h3>
            <p>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm  i/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (originating from al-Khwārizmī, the famous Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī) is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning. More precisely, an algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite list[1] of well-defined instructions[2] for calculating a function.[3] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[4] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, will proceed through a finite [5] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing &quot;output&quot;[6] and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
            <h3><a name="mathlog"></a>Mathematical logic  and algorithm theory</h3>
            <p> Mathematical logic  and algorithm theory(also known as symbolic logic) is a subfield of mathematics with close connections to the foundations of mathematics, theoretical computer science and philosophical logic.[1] The field includes both the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Mathematical logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability. In computer science (particularly in the ACM Classification) mathematical logic encompasses additional topics not detailed in this article; see logic in computer science for those.</p>

            <h3><a name="discr"></a>Discrete stucture</h3>
            <p>Discrete mathematics is mathematics that deals with discrete objects. Discrete objects are those which are separated from (not connected to/distinct from) each other. Integers (aka whole numbers), rational numbers (ones that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers), automobiles, houses, people etc. are all discrete objects. On the other hand real numbers which include rational as well as irrational numbers are not discrete. As you know between any two different real numbers there is another real number different from either of them. In this course we will be concerned with objects such as integers, propositions, sets, relations and functions, which are all discrete. We are going to learn concepts associated with them, their properties, and relationships among them among others.</p>

            <h3><a name="ped"></a>Pedagogy</h3>
            <p>Pedagogy (  /ˈpɛdəɡɒdʒi/ or /ˈpɛdəɡoʊdʒi/)[1][2] is the holistic science of education. It may be implemented in practice as a personal and holistic approach of socialising and upbringing children and young people.[3][4] The term is not to be confused with social pedagogy, where society (represented by social pedagogues) holds a bigger part of the responsibility of the citizen's (often with mental or physical disabilities) well-being.[5][6] Pedagogy is also occasionally referred to as the correct use of instructive strategies (see instructional theory). For example, Paulo Freire referred to his method of teaching people as &quot;critical pedagogy&quot;. In correlation with those instructive strategies the instructor's own philosophical beliefs of instruction are harbored and governed by the pupil's background knowledge and experience, situation, and environment,  as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. One example would be the Socratic schools of thought.</p>

            <h3><a name="phil"></a>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. [1][2]Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument.[3] The word &quot;philosophy&quot; comes from the Greek φιλοσοφία (philosophia), which literally means &quot;love of wisdom&quot;</p>

            <h3><a name="numer"></a>Numerical analysis</h3>
            <p>Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to general symbolic manipulations) for the  problems ofmathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). One of the earliest mathematical writings is a Babylonian tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection(YBC 7289), which gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of  , the length of the diagonal in a unit square. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle (and hence, being able to compute square roots) is extremely important, for instance, in carpentry and construction.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
                    <h3><a name="turkish"></a>Turkish</h3>
            <p>Turkish (Turkish:   Türkçe (help&ndash;info)), also referred to as Istanbul Turkish[5][6] or Anatolian Turkish, is the most populous of the Turkic languages, with over 70 million native speakers.[3]Speakers are located predominantly in Turkey, with smaller groups in Germany, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Northern Cyprus, Greece, and other parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The roots of the language can be traced to Central Asia, with the first known written records dating back nearly 1,300 years. To the west, the influence of Ottoman Turkish—the variety of the Turkish language that was used as the administrative and literary language of theOttoman  Empire—spread as the Ottoman Empire expanded. In 1928, as one of Atatürk's Reforms in the early years of the Republic of Turkey, the Ottoman script was replaced with aLatin alphabet. Concurrently, the newly founded Turkish Language Association initiated a drive to reform and standardize the language.</p>

            <h3><a name="ds"></a>Data structure</h3>
            <p>In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.[1][2]Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, B-trees are particularly well-suited for implementation of databases, while compilerimplementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.Data structures provide a means to manage huge amounts of data efficiently, such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are a key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design.</p>

            <h3><a name="pl"></a>A programming language</h3>
            <p>A programming language is an artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely.	The earliest programming languages predate the invention of the computer, and were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos[citation needed]. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, with  many more being created every year. Most programming languages describe computation in an imperative style, i.e., as a sequence of commands, although some languages, such as those that support functional programming or logic programming, use alternative forms of description.</p>

            <h3><a name="ee"></a>Electrotechnics and electronics</h3>
            <p>The aim of the course is to teach students to evaluate the condition of electrical equipment and its adaptation potential as well as reveal the factors of operation improving, be able to choose the equipment professionally in order to increase productivity of foodstuff made of  plants. The course consists of 3 interrelated modules representing the structural-functional communication of electric circuits theory, electromagnetic devices, fundamentals of electronics and electric measuring. The successive and systematic study of the course will provide students with knowledge of electrotechnics fundamentals, their connection with the principles of electrical equipment and electronic equipment building. The course should also teach students the essence of electromagnetic processes in an electric circuit, their dependence on energy sources and receivers as well as their significance for the efficient use of electrical equipment. This course is basic for all courses using knowledge on electrical equipment.</p>

            <h3><a name="cg"></a>Computer graphics</h3>
            <p>Computer graphics are graphics created using computers and, more generally, the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer with help from specializedsoftware and hardware. The development of computer graphics has made computers easier to interact with, and better for understanding and interpreting many types of data. Developments in computer graphics have had a profound impact on many types of media and have revolutionizedanimation, movies and the video game industry. </p>

            <h3><a name="eg"></a>Engineering graphics</h3>
            <p>Engineering graphics is the creation of engineering drawings. These are representations of physical objects/locations on paper (or in 2 dimensional or 3 Dimensional electronic format). In a typical introductory engineering graphics course it covers the basics of drawing view creation (left side, right side, etc.), presetantation of lines (Hidden, no hidden) and projections such as isometric. It also inlcudes things like dimensioning, tolerancing and other items required to properly communicate the concept to another person.</p>

            <h3><a name="de"></a>Differential equation</h3>
            <p>A differential equation is a mathematical equation for an unknown function of one or severalvariables that relates the values of the function itself and its derivatives of various orders. Differential equations play a prominent role in engineering, physics, economics, and other disciplines. Differential equations arise in many areas of science and technology, specifically whenever adeterministic relation involving some continuously	varying quantities (modeled by functions) and their rates of change in space and/or time (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is illustrated in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In some cases, this differential equation (called an equation of motion) may be solved explicitly.</p>

            <h3><a name="econom"></a>Economics</h3>
            <p>Economics is the social science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumptionof goods and services. The term economics comes from the Ancient Greek οἰκονομία(oikonomia, &quot;management of a household, administration&quot;) from οἶκος (oikos, &quot;house&quot;) +νόμος (nomos, &quot;custom&quot; or &quot;law&quot;), hence &quot;rules of the house(hold)&quot;.[1] Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the latter 19th century 	suggested 'economics' as a shorter term for 'economic science' that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to 'mathematics', 'ethics', and so forth.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
            <h3><a name=a"assem"></a>An assembly language</h3>
            <p>An assembly language is a low-level programming language for a computer, microcontroller, or other programmable device, in which each statement corresponds to a single machine codeinstruction. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most high-level programming languages, which are generally portable across multiple systems. Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler; the conversion process is  referred to as assembly, or assembling the code. Assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent each low-level machine operation oropcode. Some opcodes require one or more operands as part of the instruction, and most assemblers can take labels and symbols as operands to represent addresses and constants, instead of hard coding them into the program.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
            <h3><a name="theory"></a>Theory of competition</h3>
            <p>Theory of competition theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with whether and how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory,computability theory and computational complexity theory.[1] In order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible &quot;reasonable&quot; model of computation (see Church–Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory. So in principle, any problem that can be solved (decided) by a Turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a bounded amount of memory.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
            <h3><a name="comar"></a>Computer architecture</h3>
            <p>Computer science and engineering, computer architecture refers to specification of the relationship between different hardware components of	a computer system.[1] It may also refer to the practical art of defining the structure and relationship of the subcomponents of a computer. As	in the architecture of buildings, computer architecture can comprise many levels of information. The highest level of the definition conveys the concepts implement. Whereas in building architecture this over-view is normally visual, computer architecture is primarily logical, 	positing a conceptual system that serves a particular purpose. In both instances (building and computer), many levels of detail are required to completely specify a given implementation, and some of these details are often implied as common practice. For example, at a high level, computer architecture is concerned with how the central processing unit (CPU) acts and how it accessescomputer memory. Some currently (2011) fashionable computer architectures include cluster computing and Non-Uniform Memory Access.</p>
            <div class="top">[<a href="#top">Top Page</a>]</div>
            
            
            <h3><a name="softe"></a>Software engineering</h3>
            <p>Software engineering (SE) is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software.[1] [2] [3] The termsoftware engineering first appeared in the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, and was meant to provoke thought regarding the perceived &quot;software crisis&quot; at the time. Software development, a much used and more generic term, does not necessarily subsume the engineering paradigm. The field's future looks bright according to Money Magazine and Salary.com, which rated Software Engineer as the best job in the United States in 2006.[6]In 2012, software engineering was again ranked as the best job in the United States, this time by CareerCast.com.</p>

            <h3><a name="functional"></a>Functional logic programming</h3>
            <p>Functional logic programming is the combination, in a single programming language, of the paradigms of functional programming (including higher-order programming) and logic programming (non-deterministic programming, unification). This style of programming was pioneered in λProlog[1] in the 1990s. Other, newer functional logic programming language include Curry and Mercury.</p>

            <h3><a name="micro"></a>A microprocessor</h3>
            <p>A microprocessor incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC),[1] or at most a few integrated circuits.[2] It is a multipurpose,programmable device that accepts digital data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. It is an example of sequential digital logic, as it has internal memory. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. The advent of low-cost computers on integrated circuits has transformed modern society. General-purpose microprocessors in personal computers are used for computation, text editing, multimedia display, and communication over the Internet. Many more microprocessors are part of embedded systems, providing digital control of a myriad of objects from appliances to automobiles to cellular phones and industrial process control.</p>

            <p>This page is here to outline the different kinds of technologies available to you on the web, what they do, and how you might best make use of them.HTML/XHTMLOver the years Web Technologies have continued to develop so that now, virtually any type of audio-visual media can be 'carried' via the Internet.Most of these technologies however, have effectively been 'bolted-on' to the original web page construction 	language; Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). You'll notice most web addresses begin with 'http://' which means 'Hyper Text Transfer Protocol', and end with .HTM or .HTML. (In case you're wondering, the 'HTM' extension is for backward-compatibility with older 'Windows' DOS computers, which had a limit of only 3 letters).</p>

            <h3><a name="automata"></a>Automata theory</h3>
            <p>In theoretical computer science, automata theory is the study of mathematical objectscalled abstract machines or automata and the computational problems that can be solved using them. Automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα meaning &quot;self-acting&quot;.
            The figure at right illustrates a finite state machine, which belongs to one well-known variety of automaton. This automaton consists of states	 		(represented in the figure by circles), and transitions (represented by arrows). As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition		 		 (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function(which takes the current state and the recent symbol as its inputs).</p>

            <h3><a name="como"></a>Computer Organization</h3>
            <p>Computer Organization refers to the level of abstraction above the digital logic level, but below the operating system level. At this level,	the major components are functional units or subsystems that correspond to specific pieces of hardware built from the lower level building blocks described in the previous module. A closely related term, computer architecture, emphasizes the engineering decisions and tradeoffs that must be made in order to produce a &quot;good&quot; design. The computer architect answers questions like... How many registers should there be? What machine instructions should there be? How should the cache be organized? What hardware support should there be for virtual memory?</p>

            <h3><a name="anos"></a>An operating system</h3>
            <p>An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardwareresources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs require an operating system to function. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources. For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and will frequently make asystem call to an OS function or be interrupted by it. Operating systems can be found on almost any device that contains a computer—from cellular phones and video game consolesto supercomputers and web servers.</p>

            <h3><a name="datab"></a>Database</h3>
            <p>A database is an organized collection of data, today typically in digital form. The data are typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies). The term database is correctly applied to the data and their supporting data structures, and not to the database management system(DBMS). The database data collection with DBMS is called a database system. The term database system implies that the	data is managed to some level of quality (measured in terms of accuracy, availability, usability, and resilience) and this in turn often 	implies the use of a general-purpose database management system (DBMS).[1] A general-purpose DBMS is typically a complex software system that meets many usage requirements to properly maintain its databases which are often large and complex. The utilization of databases is now so 		 		widespread that virtually every technology and product relies on databases and DBMSs for its development and commercialization, or even may  have DBMS software embedded in it. Organizations and companies, from small to large, depend heavily on databases for their operations.</p>

            <p>The telecommunications industry includes wireless technology, computer networks, telephone systems, television, and radio. Research 	facilities, manufacturers, and network providers fuel this fast-paced field. The application of electrical engineering and physics has revolutionized business and personal communications by increasing transmission rates, reliability, and range. Elements of human communication including data, voice, images and movies are now transmitted in seconds around the globe. In addition, advances in technology have significantly decreased the size of communication devices.</p>

            <p>Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation and application of robots [1] and computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans, in hazardous or manufacturing processes, or simply just resemble humans. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. The concept and creation of machines that could operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.[2] Throughout history, robotics has been often seen to mimic human behavior, and often manage tasks in a similar fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as we continue to research, design, and build new robots that serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. 		 		Many robots do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, exploring shipwrecks, and mines.</p>

            <h3><a name="oop"></a>Object-oriented programming</h3>
            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm using &quot;objects&quot; –i.e.instances of a class consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer programs. Programming techniques may include features such as data abstraction, encapsulation, messaging, modularity, polymorphism, andinheritance. Many modern programming languages now support OOP, at least as an option.</p>

            <p>Programming language theory (PLT) is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and their individual features. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering and linguistics. It is a well-recognized branch of computer science.</p>

            <h3><a name="vo"></a>Visual Objects</h3>
            <p>Visual Objects(VOP) is an object-oriented computer programming language that is used to create software programs that operate primarily under Windows. Although it can be used as a general-purpose programming tool, it is almost exclusively used to create database programs. The original Visual Objects project (code-named Aspen) was started as part of Nantucket's attempts to bring the Clipper language to Windows, and move from the procedural to the object-oriented style. It also converted Clipper from a p-code system to being a true native compiler and introduced more elements of the C language (such as typed variables), while including Windows extensions (such as COM,ODBC, and later ADO). With its symbol datatype, it offers the ability to form name-based linkages, which may be used to connect menuevents to object methods or form direct linkages between server columns and controls.</p>

            <h3><a name="ai"></a>Artificial intelligence</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as &quot;the study and design of intelligent agents&quot;[1] where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.[2] John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955,[3] defines it as &quot;the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.&quot; AI research is highly technical and specialized, deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.[5] Some of the division is due to social and cultural factors: subfields have grown up around particular institutions and the work of individual researchers. AI research is also divided by several technical issues. There are subfields which are focussed on the solution	of specific problems, on one of several possible approaches, on the use of widely differing tools and towards the accomplishment of particular applications. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[6] General intelligence (or &quot;strong AI&quot;) is still among the field's long term goals.</p>

            <p>Network technology refers to the hardware and software used to connect a group of two or more computers. In scope, it can encompass setting up peer-to-peer connection, through local area networks (lans) and even includes an understanding of how the internet and the world wide web function.</p>

            <h3><a name="is"></a>Information security</h3>
            <p>Information security means protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction.[1] The terms information security, computer security and information assurance are frequently used interchangeably. These fields are interrelated often and share the common goals of protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information; however, there are some subtle differences between them. These differences lie primarily in the approach to the subject, the methodologies used, and the areas of concentration. Information security is concerned with the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data regardless of the form the data may take: electronic, print, or other forms. Computer security can focus on ensuring the availability and correct operation of a computer system without concern for the information stored or processed by the computer. Information assurance focuses on the reasons for assurance that information is protected, and is thus reasoning about information security.</p>

            <p>The publication Life Safety Code, known as NFPA 101, is a consensus standard widely adopted in the United States. It is administered, trademarked, copyrighted, and published by the National Fire Protection Association and, like many NFPA documents, is systematically revised on a three year cycle. Despite its title, the standard is not a legal code, is not published as an instrument of law, and has no statutory  authority in its own right. However, it is deliberately crafted with language suitable for mandatory application to facilitate adoption into law by those empowered to do so.</p>

            <h3><a name="metro"></a>Metrology and standartization</h3>
            <p>METROLOGY AND STANDARTIZATION GOST (Russian: ГОСТ) refers to a set of technical standards maintained by the Euro-Asian Council for Standardization, Metrology and Certification (EASC), a regional standards organization operating under the auspices of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). All sorts of regulated standards are included, with examples ranging from charting rules for design documentation to	recipes and nutritional facts of Soviet-era brand names (which have now become generic, but may only be sold under the label if the technical standard is followed, or renamed if they are reformulated). GOST standards were originally developed by the government of the Soviet Union as part of its national standardization strategy. The word GOST (Russian: ГОСТ) is an acronym forgosudarstvennyy standart, which means state standard. The history of national standards in the USSR can be traced back to 1925, when a  government agency, later named Gosstandart, was established and put in charge of writing, updating, publishing, and disseminating the standards. After World War II, the national standardization program went through a major transformation.[citation needed] The first GOST standard, GOST 1State Standardization System, was published in 1968. The following countries have adopted GOST standards in addition to their own, nationally developed standards: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine,Moldova, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, and Turkmenistan.</p>

            <h3><a name="pro"></a>Project management</h3>
            <p>Project management is the discipline of planning, organizing, securing, managing, leading, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. A project is a temporary endeavor with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or deliverables),[1] undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives,[2] typically to bring about beneficial change or added value. The temporary nature of projects stands in contrast with business as usual (or operations),[3] which are repetitive, permanent, or semi-permanent functional activities to produce products or services. In practice, the management of these two systems is often quite different, and as such requires the development of distinct technical skills and management strategies.</p>
